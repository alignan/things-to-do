# My 2017 challenge: 26 things to do before the year ends

Although 2017 is just three months to end, it is better now than never to start this challenge, which I originally read from ["100 things Justing could make in 2016"](https://docs.google.com/document/d/16gVonXDjdvlj6yBP-hOmbktugZ3-QkLOw_nhRN9xlUs/edit) upon looking for things that, once again, would motivate my lazy ass to go beyond my comfort zone.

Why 26? because I hope to do at least two per week (I'm writing this on September 20th)

So here it goes, without any prioritization, the ***Twenty six things to do before 2017 ends***
